<p>The global shipping industry, like many others, is under growing pressure to be more sustainable. 
Regulation, renewable energy advances and customer demand have created a golden opportunity to make 
shipping more environmentally sustainable, which, however, entails significant funding. 
Traditional ship financing has been done largely on a secured basis, with relatively few considerations 
around sustainability and environmental protection. This approach is ripe for innovation, given the industry’s 
significant environmental footprint. Evidence from other industries suggests that borrowers could benefit
in pricing and structure from sustainable borrowing mechanisms, such as green bonds (where proceeds are dedicated
to environmental and social investment). The trend is also increasing for sustainable loans, which can help 
to meet the growing demand for retrofit financing within existing vessels to meet CO2 emission targets.</p>

<p>Our research aimed to explore the attitudes of shipping industry participants, through the use of a survey,
to green financing, that is, issuing unsecured and covered green, social, and sustainable bonds and other related 
financing instruments. These could effectively advance the environmental and social agenda in the industry, 
strengthening environmental, social, and governance (ESG) structures at the same time. Preliminary results 
suggest that there is considerable scope for improving knowledge and awareness among marine professionals
to bridge the sustainability gap.</p>

<p>The UK Government aims to build a low-carbon, ‘green growth’ economy to meet net-zero and biodiversity goals, 
level up the economy, and establish a leading global green sector. This report examines how to finance the green 
transition for established SMEs in England. Previous research highlighted uneven access to debt finance for SMEs,
with smaller, less-resourced SMEs in remote areas facing the most challenges. In 2024 we conducted 21 qualitative 
interviews with supply-side stakeholders, including banks, non-bank debt providers, finance brokers,
and business support organizations, focusing on London and the rural South-West.</p>

<p>Key findings reveal a two-tier SME financing system in England: larger, well-resourced SMEs 
can access traditional bank debt finance and government green grants, while smaller, less-resourced SMEs
struggle due to insufficient internal funds, information, and external finance options. 
These smaller SMEs often turn to alternative non-bank debt finance, sometimes through brokers, 
who play a crucial but inconsistent and unregulated role. Additionally, limited and poorly targeted
grant funding, along with landlord-tenant property restrictions, hinder the green transition for many SMEs.</p>

<p>‘Accountancy Magazine’, is an official publication of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). As such it is a snapshot of how the ICAEW utilizes imagery to portray its identity to its members. There has been a steady stream of research on visual elements in accounting by examining the depictions of women and minority ethnic groups in publications of professional bodies. Our research investigates the images in 39 issues of Accountancy Magazine from July 2008- September 2011- when the magazine was discontinued.</p>
<h2 id="the-professions-after-the-milburn-report-and-equality-act">The professions after the Milburn report and Equality Act</h2>
<p>Accountancy appeared to react to a certain extent to the publication of the Milburn report and the Equality Act. There were statisticallyÿsignificant changes in the number of images of women and ethnic minorities depicted in positions of authority or as accountants. Moreover, there was a statistically significant change in the number of images showing accountants of any gender or ethnicity after the publications of the Milburn Report and the Equality Act. These findings suggest that Accountancyÿreacted toÿexternal initiatives for changes in the professionÿby depicting images reflecting the readership of the magazine</p>
<h2 id="there-is-still-some-work-to-do">There is still some work to do</h2>
<p>Our statistical analysis also presents strong evidence of the overwhelming representation of white male accountants and white men in positions of authority in Accountancy magazine. The main empirical finding is that although there is a genuine attempt to reflect the diversity of the profession, it is clear that Accountancyÿis still signalling that they see an accountant as white and male.</p>
<h2 id="practical-implications">Practical implications</h2>
<p>The study has significant policy initiatives for all UK accountancy bodies. The paper argues that more attention needs to be paid by those responsible for constructing these representations and how gender and ethnicity and related issues are depicted and communicated in official publications from the accountancy bodies to both its membership and to outside audiences.</p>

The results are more general than the current framework, and encompass the conventional formula for pricing  bonds at coupon dates as a special case.</p>

<p>Let \(y\in \mathbb{R}\), let \(M, i, w \in \mathbb{R}_{++}\), and let \(N\in \mathbb{N}\), then the fair price of a coupon bond between coupon payments is</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
P=q^{w}\left(M\,i\,\frac{1-q^{N+1}}{1-q}+M\,q^{N}\right)\label{tbasic}
\end{equation}</p>

<p><b>Proof</b></p>

<p>Let \(q\equiv \frac{1}{(1+y)}\), then,</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
P=q^{w}\left(M\,i\sum_{t=0}^{N} q^{t}+M\, q^{N}\right)\label{treasury1}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>The sum can be expanded to</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
S=q^{0}+q^{1}+q^{2}+…+q^{N}\label{tsum1a}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Multiplying both sides of (\ref{tsum1a}) by \(q\),</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
qS=q^{1}+q^{2}+…+q^{N}+q^{N+1}\label{tsum1b}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>and subtracting (\ref{tsum1b}) from (\ref{tsum1a}), we find</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
S=\frac{1-q^{N+1}}{1-q}\label{tsum1d}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Substituting (\ref{tsum1d}) into (\ref{treasury1}) yields (\ref{tbasic}).</p>

<p>Gottschalk(2022) constructs a structural model of a synthetic CDO where the underlying is a portfolio of government bonds of all the 19 Eurozone countries, and the default correlation structure of portfolio loss is modeled as a Bernoulli mixture. We show that expected tranche losses of CDOs are accurately calculated by saddlepoint approximations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that under correlation structures implying higher probabilities of extreme events, even high levels of subordination cannot shield the senior tranche from default losses.</p>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>The value of government’s fiscal balance can be described by a multi-factor model</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
D_{n}=\sum_{j}\rho_{n,j}F_j + a_{n}Z_{n}\label{factor1}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>for \(n=1,\ldots,N\). \(F_j\), \(j=1,\dots,J\), are i.i.d. standard Normal distributions, and \(a_n^2+\sum_{j=1}^{J}\rho_{n,j}^2=1\), with \(\rho_{n,j} \in [0,1]\). These factors \(\mathbf{F} \in R^J\) represent global macroeconomic variables that affect all Eurozone countries, e.g., the 2008 Financial Crisis, the 2011-2014 Eurozone Sovereign Debt Crisis, or the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. \(Z_{n}\), on the  contrary, is a country-specific, idiosyncratic factor that only affects country \(n\). Both \(\mathbf{F}\) and \(Z_n\) are mutually independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Vasicek (1987) has shown individual defaults are independent of each other given the occurrence of the factor \(\mathbf{F}\). The probability of individual defaults conditional on \(\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{u}\), \(p_n(\mathbf{u})\), is given by</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
P[D_n&lt;K_n|\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{u}]=p_n(\mathbf{u})=P\left[Z_{n}&lt;\frac{K_n-\boldsymbol{\rho^{T} F}}{\sqrt{1-\sum_{j=1}^{J}\rho_{n,j}^2}}\right]=\Phi\left(\frac{K_n-\boldsymbol{\rho^T F}}{\sqrt{1-\sum_{j=1}^{J}\rho_{n,j}^2}}\right)\label{cond1c}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where \(\Phi\) is the cumulative Normal distribution, \(\boldsymbol{\rho}\,, \mathbf{F} \in \mathbb{R}^J\), and \(\mathbf{u} \in \mathbb{R}^J\), and \(\boldsymbol{\rho}^T\) is the transpose of \(\boldsymbol{\rho}\).</p>

<p>Table 1 summarises the simulation inputs, which were taken from Brunnermeier et al.(2017), Rossi (2019), and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB, 2018a,b) in order to allow comparison of our results with theirs. Table 1 ranks countries in ascending order of default probability. The country more likely to default is Greece, with a default probability of 95%. Brunnermeier et al.(2017) selected these rates from Deutsche Bank’s default probabilities inferred from Credit Default Swaps (CDS) spreads assuming a 40% constant LGD rate. As can be seen from Table 1, this is the LGD assumed for Germany, The Netherlands and Luxembourg.  For other countries, Brunnermeier et al.(2017) calculated analogous default probabilities as those implied by CDS spreads in December 2015. Three levels of correlation with the global factor are considered, 30, 50 and 70 percent. Finally, we calculated other parameters, e.g., portfolio weights, in order to ensure model consistency.</p>

<p>[Table 2. Cumulative expected tranche loss (as % of total expected loss) - Student t copula]</p>

<p>Table 2 shows the expected tranche losses of the EJBies and ESBies, when 1 million  Monte Carlo simulations of equation (\ref{factor1})  with Student t copula are run. The Student t distribution has heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution, and has long been recognised as more appropriate to capture extreme financial losses. The value of the total expected loss has increased to \(E[L]\) = 0.17 and the maximum possible loss is \(L_{max}\) = 66 percent of the underlying portfolio. Table 2 clearly shows that even at a 50/50 subordination level the Senior tranche incurs losses of at least 17% of the total expected portfolio losses (\(\rho=0.3\)). These are the lowest levels of losses of all the subordination schemes. For the 10/90 subordination, the expected losses of the Senior tranche are the highest and reach 60% (\(\rho=0.7\)). For 10/90, \(\rho=0.3\) and \(\rho=0.5\),  the expected losses of the Senior tranche are 0.56%.</p>

The article refers to the use of CAPM’s expected return of a stock as a discount factor in corporate valuation models.</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\label{eq:PV}
PV_t=\sum_{s\geq 1}\frac{E_t\left[CF_{t+s}\right]}{\left(1+r\right)^s}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where \(PV_t\) is the present value of the expected cash flows of the project (or asset), \(CF_{t+s}\) are the future cash flows, \(E_t[.]\), the expectation operator, and \(r\) the discount rate. This generic model has many applications, e.g., the perpetual dividend model (PV would be the stock price), or project valuation.</p>

<p>The discount rate should also be stochastic in model (\ref{eq:PV}), since it is usually based on the CAPM equation</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
\label{eq:capm}<br />
E_t[R_{it}]= r_f+\beta\left(E_t[R_{mt}]-r_f\right)
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where \(R_{it}\) is the return of the stock at time \(t\), \(R_f\) the risk-free rate and \(R_{mt}\) the market return. CAPM’s flaw as a predictor of stock prices come from the confusion between risk and volatility! Beta is a measure of volatility, not risk, and the discount rate required for project and stock price valuation should be a measure of risk. The average realized return of high beta securities does not differ much from low beta securities (Frazzini and Pedersen 2014, Hong and Sraer 2016)
Despite all this, CAPM is still commonly used by firms to calculate discount rates (Graham 2022, Jagannathan et al. 2016, Gormsen and Huber 2022).</p>

There were also a couple of industry applications presented. One of them, Smart Data Foundry, builds on the agent-based models to create synthetic data. The presentation showed how synthetic data can be used by banks to simulate the behaviour of clients without using actual personal data, which can be problematic due to confidentiality requirements or disclosure risks.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-synthetic-data">What are synthetic data?</h4>

<p>Synthetic data are computationally generated to replicate the same characteristics of real data: people, firms, events, interatcions between firms and people. The main difference is that part of these characteristics, or all of them, are artificial. Synthetic data are useful to</p>

<ul>
    <li>enable applications that would not be possible with real data</li>
    <li>increase existing datasets to allow the analysis of new scenarios, which cannot be simulated with existing data</li>
    <li>run simulations without putting at risk the data of real peoples</li>
    <li>simulate events for which there are no data, e.g., impact of Brexit before Brexit</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-are-synthetic-data-generated">How are synthetic data generated?</h4>

<p>Two main approaches were presented:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Agent-based modelling (ABM): was developed in economics in the 1990s as agent-based computational economics (ACE). An "agent" is any entity capable of affecting the trajectory of outcomes for a system, such as decision-making entities (e.g., "humans") or physical phenomena with no cognitive function (e.g., "weather"). One of the main characteristics of ABM is the large number of heterogeneous agents. This strongly contrasts with mainstream economics models which are based on the representative consumer, the representative firm, or the representative central planner.</li>
    <li>Learning-based synthesis: is based on machine learning and machine training on real data. A model is created and trained on real data to learn the patterns in the dataset. The learned patterns are then used to generate synthetic data with the same characteristics and patterns of the real data.</li>
    
</ul>

<h4 id="why-synthetic-data">Why synthetic data?</h4>

<p>The concept of synthetic data is puzzling for academics, who aim to produce research that leads to accurate predictions, even though economic models are abstract and rely on simplifying assumptions (e.g. representative consumer). Using real data is thus fundamental for research economists. Some colleagues were disturbed by the very concept of synthetic data, which they interpreted as “fake” data. I had a conversation with the Smart Data Foundry’s Principal Data Scientist Paola Arce, and asked why not use anonymised real data instead of synthetic data. Paola explained that anonymised data may be made available to academics but never to businesses. Even regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority would have difficulty accessing personal data from firms outside their remit (e.g. data from the Payment Systems Regulator). Synthetic data fill this gap and allow businesses and regulators to analyse consumer behaviour.</p>

<hr />

<p>The presentation was very enlightening and it is good to see real life applications of agent-based models. Hopefully, these models will become more mainstream in economics and finance syllabi.</p>

In the UK, the total number of bank and building society branches fell by 34% between 2012 and 2021 
(See Booth 2022, Browning 2022, Edmonds 2018 and Small Business Finance Markets Report 2023 by the British Business Bank BBB 2023).</p>

<p>Gopal &amp; Schnabl (2022) investigate the credit supply to small businesses in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis in the US. 
The data cover 3,717 banks and 3,841 nonbanks, mostly finance companies and FinTech lenders, 
which tended to lend to smaller firms. They show that nonbank lenders almost perfectly offset the 
decline in bank lending during the financial crisis. Gopal &amp; Schnabl (2022)'s results suggest that 
P2P and bank lending to SMEs might be complements, rather than substitutes. Tang (2019), on the other hand, 
found that P2P to US consumers between 2009 and 2012 tended to be complement to bank credit.</p>

<p>Bank credit to SMEs also declined in the UK in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, 
but took seven years to recover to pre-2008 levels, and data from the Bank of England clearly
show that peer-to-peer (P2P) lending started growing exactly in the same year bank lending reached the 2008 level . 
This suggests that P2P and bank lending to SMEs might be complements, rather than substitutes as found by Gopal &amp; Schnabl (2022). 
To the extent of our knowledge there is no such empirical research in the UK.</p>

<h2 id="defi-performance-in-2022-2023">DeFi PERFORMANCE IN 2022-2023</h2>

<p>DeFi has performed better than bitcoin in the past 12 months. The trading volume in DEX fell from <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/decentralized-finance/dex-non-custodial">$133.54bn in May 2022 to $57.16bn in May 2023</a>, a 5.7% decline.  The trading volume of bitcoin fell from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/">$18.09bn to $8.65</a>, a 52% fall. This has led some in the crypto community to believe that DeFi is the future of the crypto ecosystem, after the demise of FTX.</p>

<h3 id="defi-claims-to-have-better-governance-than-traditional-crypto-exchanges">DeFi claims to have better governance than traditional crypto exchanges</h3>
<p>Most crypto platforms play multiple roles that are required by regulation to be independent in traditional finance (TradFi), broker, exchange, market maker and custodian. The failure of FTX also exposed loose governance systems, allegedly allowing FTX to use customer assets to make <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cc3c3402-785d-4441-9edf-743bb0596ea6">illiquid investments in its affiliated companies</a>.
DeFi differs from crypto exchanges in that customers maintain custody of their own crypto assets and transact using protocols without centralised intermediaries.</p>

<h3 id="regulators-are-not-convinced">Regulators are not convinced</h3>
<p>In the wake of FTX’s fraudulent bankruptcy, US regulators have started to seriously analyse the potential risks posed by DeFi. SEC chair Gary Gensler has made clear that regulators will not be asleep on the wheel in the case of DeFi and that trading platforms should be regulated as securities exchanges: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-ats-041423">Calling yourself a DeFi platform is no excuse to defy the securities law</a></p>

<h2 id="defi-vs-crypto-exchange">DeFi vs CRYPTO EXCHANGE</h2>
<p>Both DeFi platforms and crypto exchanges are based on blockchain, but there are major differences. Crypto exchanges provide a platform for the trade of various cryptocurrencies against each other or against fiat. Crypto exchanges may also trade NFTs.<br />
DeFis are essentially a smart contract protocols, associated with an internet website, where anyone can create an application that allows users to interact with smart contracts. These decentralised applications (DApps) facilitate the provision of financial intermediation in DeFi. However, DeFi products and services mainly interact with other DeFi products and services, such as cryptos and NFTs. DeFi platforms do not interact with traditional finance (TradFi) or the real economy. In that sense, there is very little difference between a DeFi platform and a crypto exchange. 
However, unlike pure crypto exchanges, DeFi platforms appears to provide services that are more akin to those of TradFi:</p>
<ol>
<li>pool resources in support of large projects from decentralised sources</li> 
<li> provide price information for various assets </li>
<li> provide liquidity and liquidity pools on their platforms</li>
</ol>
<p>The main difference with TradFi is that DeFi is based on systems in which computer code and decentralised validators verify the legitimacy of transactions and the availability of funds to execute them.</p>

<h2 id="are-us-regulators-taking-steps-to-preempt-a-new-ftx-style-debacle">ARE US REGULATORS TAKING STEPS TO PREEMPT A NEW FTX-STYLE DEBACLE?</h2>
<p>On 14th April 2023, the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-77">SEC</a>  officially opened a comment period on proposed amendments to the definition of “exchange” under Exchange Act Rule 3b-16.  The objective is clear: to extend the applicability of existing rules to platforms that trade crypto asset securities, including DeFi systems. SEC Chair Gary Gensler made it clear that  “[…]many crypto trading platforms already come under the current definition of an exchange and thus have an existing duty to comply with the securities laws.”</p>

<h2 id="why-now">WHY NOW?</h2>

<p>If crypto trading platforms and DeFi interfaces already come under the current definition of an exchange, and thus should have been regulated as such, it is surprising that this announcement is made more than a decade after these exchanges started to operate. A possible explanation is that bitcoin, NFT, and pure crypto exchanges did not actually assume the economic role of traditional financial intermediaries -let alone replace fiat- despite claims to the contrary by crypto enthusiasts. Early on, most regulators treated cryptos are a new asset class, and concluded that their low capitalisation -relative to the global financial market- did not pose dangers to international financial stability. This evaluation has proved correct in the light of FTX’s bankruptcy and the crash of Terra’s stablecoin Luna.</p>

<p>Recent investigation by the <a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P160223.pdf">FSB</a> is unearthing many similarities between the traditional financial system and the activities of DeFi platforms. Although DeFi is still “talking to itself”, when it starts acting like a financial intermediary in the real economy its regulatory flaws may cause instability in the financial system.</p>

<p>DeFi systems run exclusively on smart contracts, without any recourse from regulators, the courts, or even the DeFi platform itself. “Code is law” is the underlying principle of smart contracts that make up DeFi protocols. But there are documented cases of massive <a href="https://payspacemagazine.com/all/3-famous-smart-contract-fails/">smart contract failures</a> which have led to significant financial losses for investors.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="DeFi," /><category term="crypto," /><category term="regulation" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decentralized Finance regulation]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">EU regulates crypto markets (MiCA)</title><link href="https://sdgottschalk.github.io//sgottschalk.io/blog/2023/table-of-contents/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="EU regulates crypto markets (MiCA)" /><published>2023-03-20T15:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-20T15:59:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sdgottschalk.github.io//sgottschalk.io/blog/2023/table-of-contents</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sdgottschalk.github.io//sgottschalk.io/blog/2023/table-of-contents/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="european-union-regulates-market-in-crypto-assets-mica">EUROPEAN UNION REGULATES MARKET IN CRYPTO-ASSETS (MiCA)</h2>

<p>In April 2023 the European Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230414IPR80133/crypto-assets-green-light-to-new-rules-for-tracing-transfers-in-the-eu">approved regulation</a> requiring exchanges and wallet providers to obtain a license and stablecoin issuers to hold appropriate reserves. However, the implementation details were not defined and were delegated to the European Supervisory Authority (ESMA), which is the European supervisory authority. ESMA will have to draft and consult on the “substantial package of implementing measures” that lie underneath the published regulation. This suggests that it is unlikely that a EU-wide regulatory framework will be operational in the next 3 years. The MiCA regulation approved in April 2023 will take effect only in mid-2024. Until ESMA provides EU-wide directives and technical regulatory standards (or “level-two legislation”), the supervision and regulation of crypto-assets will be carried out by member states.</p>

<h3 id="there-are-many-exclusions">There are many exclusions</h3>
<p>The Act <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/PE-54-2022-INIT/en/pdf">excludes many crypto-assets</a> (pp 8-9) , e.g., those that qualify as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>financial instruments</li>
  <li>deposits, including structured deposits, funds, except if they qualify as electronic money tokens (‘e-money tokens’)</li>
  <li>securitisation positions </li>
  <li>non-life or life insurance contracts, pensions products or schemes and social security schemes</li>
  <li>NFTs and other tokens, "crypto-assets that are unique and not fungible with other crypto-assets, including digital art and collectibles"</li>
 <li>Digital assets issued by central banks acting in their monetary authority capacity</li>
</ol>

<p>Electronic money and funds received in exchange for electronic money should not be treated as deposits, e-money tokens cannot be treated as deposits that are excluded as well.</p>

<h3 id="concerns-with-climate-change-and-environmental-impacts">Concerns with climate change and environmental impacts</h3>

<p>The first EU-wide regulation of crypto-assets is concerned with the environmental sustainability of the consensus mechanisms used for the validation of transactions in crypto-assets.</p>

<p>The text urges crypto-businesses to create consensus mechanisms that are more environmentally-friendly. Responsible governance is also advised: “[..] any principal adverse impact that they might have on the climate and any other environment-related adverse impact are adequately identified and disclosed by issuers of crypto-assets and crypto-asset service providers” (p.6). The concern for the environmental impact is such that the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (ESMA) will be mandated to develop draft regulatory technical standards in relation to sustainability indicators, identify adverse impacts on climate and outline key energy indicators.</p>

<p>This is an interesting approach by the EU, since the measurement of environmental impacts of financial activities does not usually fall within the scope of financial regulators.</p>

<h3 id="crypto-and-financial-stability">Crypto and financial stability</h3>

<p>The EU recognises that crypto markets do not pose a threat to financial stability. The main reason put forward is their relatively small capitalisation relative to the global financial system. It is, however, possible that types of crypto-assets that
aim to stabilise their price in relation to a specific asset or a basket of assets could in the
future be widely adopted by retail holders, and such a development could raise additional
challenges in terms of financial stability, the smooth operation of payment systems,
monetary policy transmission or monetary sovereignty.</p>

<h2 id="positive-approach-to-crypto-assets">POSITIVE APPROACH TO CRYPTO-ASSETS</h2>

<p>the EU appears to see some <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/PE-54-2022-INIT/en/pdf">societal and economic value</a>.
to crypto-assets: “offers of crypto-assets could allow for an innovative and inclusive way of financing, including for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (p.2)</p>

<h3 id="sharp-contrast-with-the-ecb">Sharp contrast with the ECB</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2022/html/ecb.blog221130~5301eecd19.en.html">ECB’s position on bitcoin and other crypto-assets</a> was published in November 2022 in the wake of FTX’s failure. Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf start with a scathing analysis of bitcoin’s economic irrelevance, except for illegal transactions.  They then justify the ECB’s reluctance to regulate bitcoin by explaining that regulation would be viewed as a signal of acceptance of cryptocurrencies in general -and of bitcoin in particular-, a position they completely disagree with. Although they acknowledge the EU’s MiCA initiative, they disapprove of it: “[..] current regulation of cryptocurrencies is partly shaped by misconceptions. The belief that space must be given to innovation at all costs stubbornly persists.” In summary, crypto-assets are useless, bitcoin is an “unprecedented polluter”, and should be left to disappear.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-just-the-start">This is just the start</h3>

<p>International financial regulation is always passive and merely reacts to disruptive events, rather than create preventive frameworks to avoid such events. Basel I came in the wake of the failure of Ambrosiano Spa. Basel II followed the 1994 Mexican Crisis, which highlighted the flaws of risk weights based on the membership of the OECD, and the 1997 Asian Crisis, which highlighted the flaws of low risk weights for short-term intra-bank loans. Basel III introduced liquidity risk weights following the 2008 Financial Crisis. Although it was kick-started in 2019, this new EU legislation comes after the fraudulent failure of FTX and the bankruptcy of Terra.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="crypto" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[regulation of crypto-assets]]></summary></entry></feed>
